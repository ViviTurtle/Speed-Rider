#Summary
----------------------

Team 2, 4: On-Demand Shuttle Service Problem statement – New shuttle services, “Speed Rider”, in the Bay Area counties (San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa) needs a system to allow sub-contracted drivers to locate their next customer request.  Require mapping, time based traffic events, and location based searches to guarantee the wait time to 30 minutes from the time of request. You are responsible to develop the website for both the customer and driver.  Customer can go onto this website and request a ride.  The cost is based on distance and time (like how a taxi works).  The website will include logic to find the next closest available driver based on real-time driving time to reach customer.  Once it does, it will dispatch the drivers to the customer location.
